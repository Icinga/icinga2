## 2.5.0 (2016-08-23)

### Notes

* InfluxdbWriter feature
* API
    * New endpoints: /v1/variables and /v1/templates (GET requests), /v1/action/generate-ticket (POST request)
    * State/type filters for notifications/users are now string values (PUT, POST, GET requests)
* Configuration
    * TimePeriod excludes/includes attributes
    * DateTime object for formatting time strings
    * New prototype methods: Array#filter, Array#unique, Array#map, Array#reduce
    * icinga2.conf now includes plugins-contrib, manubulon, windows-plugins, nscp by default (ITL CheckCommand definitions)
    * Performance improvements (config compiler and validation)
* CLI
    * 'icinga2 object list' formats state/type filters as string values
    * Compiled config files are now visible with "notice" debug level (hidden by default)
    * CA serial file now uses a hash value (HA cluster w/ 2 CA directories)
* Cluster
    * There is a known issue with >2 endpoints inside a zone. Icinga 2 will now log a warning.
    * Support for accepted ciphers and minimum TLS version
    * Connection and error logging has been improved.
* DB IDO
    * Schema upgrade required (2.5.0.sql)
    * Incremental config dump (performance boost)
    * `categories` attribute is now an array. Previous method is deprecated and to be removed.
    * DbCatLog is not enabled by default anymore.
    * SSL support for MySQL
* New packages
    * vim-icinga2 for syntax highlighting
    * libicinga2 (Debian), icinga2-libs (RPM) for Icinga Studio packages
