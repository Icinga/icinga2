Upgrading Icinga 2 is usually quite straightforward. Ordinarily the only manual steps involved
are scheme updates for the IDO database.

If you're upgrading an existing Icinga 2 instance you should check the
`/usr/share/icinga2-ido-mysql/schema/upgrade` directory for an incremental schema upgrade file.

> **Note**
>
> If there isn't an upgrade file for your current version available there's nothing to do.

Apply all database schema upgrade files incrementally.

    # mysql -u root -p icinga < /usr/share/icinga2-ido-mysql/schema/upgrade/<version>.sql

The Icinga 2 DB IDO module will check for the required database schema version on startup
and generate an error message if not satisfied.


**Example:** You are upgrading Icinga 2 from version `2.0.2` to `2.3.0`. Look into
the *upgrade* directory:

    $ ls /usr/share/icinga2-ido-mysql/schema/upgrade/
    2.0.2.sql  2.1.0.sql 2.2.0.sql 2.3.0.sql

There are two new upgrade files called `2.1.0.sql`, `2.2.0.sql` and `2.3.0.sql`
which must be applied incrementally to your IDO database.

If you're updating an existing Icinga 2 instance you should check the
`/usr/share/icinga2-ido-pgsql/schema/upgrade` directory for an incremental schema upgrade file.

Apply all database schema upgrade files incrementally.

    # export PGPASSWORD=icinga
    # psql -U icinga -d icinga < /usr/share/icinga2-ido-pgsql/schema/upgrade/<version>.sql

The Icinga 2 DB IDO module will check for the required database schema version on startup
and generate an error message if not satisfied.

**Example:** You are upgrading Icinga 2 from version `2.0.2` to `2.3.0`. Look into
the *upgrade* directory:

    $ ls /usr/share/icinga2-ido-pgsql/schema/upgrade/
    2.0.2.sql  2.1.0.sql 2.2.0.sql 2.3.0.sql

There are two new upgrade files called `2.1.0.sql`, `2.2.0.sql` and `2.3.0.sql`
which must be applied incrementally to your IDO database.
