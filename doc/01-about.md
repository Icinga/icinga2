## What is Icinga 2?  <a id="what-is-icinga2"></a>

[Icinga](https://icinga.com/products/) is a monitoring system which checks
the availability of your network resources, notifies users of outages, and generates
performance data for reporting.

Scalable and extensible, Icinga can monitor large, complex environments across
multiple locations. This includes your data center as well as your private, public, or hybrid clouds.

Icinga 2 is the monitoring server and requires [Icinga Web 2](https://icinga.com/products/)
on top in your Icinga Stack. The [configuration](https://icinga.com/products/configuration/)
can be easily managed with either the [Icinga Director](https://icinga.com/docs/director/latest/),
config management tools or plain text within the [Icinga DSL](04-configuration.md#configuration).
