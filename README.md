## About

Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system which checks the availability of your
network resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting.

Scalable and extensible, Icinga 2 can monitor large, complex environments across
multiple locations.

Icinga 2 as monitoring core works best with [Icinga Web 2](https://www.icinga.com/products/icinga-web-2/)
as web interface.
