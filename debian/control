Description: host and network monitoring system
 Icinga 2 is a general-purpose monitoring application and the next generation
 after Icinga 1.x - which was a Nagios fork. It should fit the needs of a small
 environment as well as big installations.
 .
 Rewritten from scratch in C++, with multi-threading and cluster support.
 .
 Features:
  * All common features of Icinga and Nagios
  * Much faster and more scalable than Icinga 1 and Nagios
  * New configuration format, more intuitive and template based
  * Monitoring several services by executing checks (see nagios-plugins*)
    for example ICMP/ping, SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, or other TCP port
  * Any small script can be used as a check plugin, when following the Nagios
    plugin API
  * Notifications about alerts with any custom script, or shipped examples
  * Native support for Livestatus and Graphite
 .
 This is the metapackage to install all Icinga 2 features.
