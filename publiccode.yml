    shortDescription: Icinga is an enterprise-ready open source monitoring and alerting platform that scales across distributed IT environments.
    longDescription: >-
      Icinga is an open source monitoring and alerting solution for enterprises that
      require reliable oversight of availability and performance across servers, networks,
      applications, and services in on-premises, hybrid, and cloud environments. It is
      built for distributed architectures and scalability, supporting large estates where
      monitoring must keep pace with growth and change.
 
      Icinga integrates with a wide plugin and integration ecosystem to collect and
      evaluate monitoring data, then turns it into actionable dashboards, reporting, and
      event-driven alerts with flexible notification and escalation paths. This helps
      teams detect issues early, reduce downtime, and improve incident response.
 
      Our user base is broad and international, including teams operating complex
      environments and organizations running infrastructure that is critical to security
      and business continuity across industries globally.
