      Notes:

There are different ways to transcribe the word “Unicode”, depending on
the language and script. In some cases there is only one language that
customarily uses a given script; in others there are many languages. The
goal here is at a minimum to collect at least one transcription for each
script in a language customarily written in that script, with more
languages if possible. If the transcription is the same for multiple
languages in a script, then a single representative language is used.

Still missing are transcriptions for the items above in RED (in at least
one language). I would appreciate any other transcriptions, or
corrections for the ones listed here. Send to mark3@macchiato.com
<mailto:mark3@macchiato.com>, using the directions below:

    * *Supplying Missing Items*
          o Most Latin-script languages will follow the spelling, and
            change the pronunciation. For any that would not, it would
            be good to have the alternate spelling.
          o For non-Latin scripts the goal is to match the English
            pronunciation — /*not*/ spelling. Above is the IPA <#IPA>
            (in phonemic transcription) that should be matched as
            closely as possible (without sounding affected in the target
            language)
          o Text would be best in either the UTF-8 text, or the code
            points in hex HTML. E.g. either of the following:
                + "Юникод"
                + "&#x042E;&#x043D;&#x0438;&#x043A;&#x043E;&#x0434;"
                + Note: for / supplementary characters/
                  <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#supplementary_character>,
                  there should be one hex number per code point, not two
                  surrogates
                  <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#surrogate_code_point>:
                      # &#x10000; /*not*/ &#xD800;&xDC00;
          o If you have a good font, I'd also appreciate a GIF. It
            should be *96 x 24* bits, with the text centered, in black
            on white (plus grays if smoothed).
    * *Other Comments*
          o Because some browsers won't handle the text, both text and
            GIF image are supplied. If you can’t read the text columns,
            see Display Problems
            <http://www.unicode.org/help/display_problems.html>.
          o The Chinese versions (inc. Bopomofo) are translations, not
            transcriptions, since "transcription in Chinese is pretty
            lame" [J. Becker].
          o There are other "translations" of Unicode that may be in
            use, such as the Vietnamese "Thống Nhất Mã".
          o For sample pages in different languages on the Unicode site,
            see What is Unicode?
            <http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html>
          o Americans are not generally used to IPA, and find a variety
            of different systems in their dictionaries. This one leaves
            the base letters as they are, and uses diacritics for
            pronunciation.
    * *Etymology of /Unicode/*
          o Coined by J. Becker. Not related to previous usages, such as:
                + A telegraphic code in which one word or set of letters
                  represents a sentence or phrase; a telegram or message
                  in this. (late 19th century, OED)
          o According to my references, the prefix "uni" is directly
            from Latin while the word "code" is through French.
          o The original Indo-European apparently would have been
            *oino-kau-do ("one strike give"): *kau apparently being
            related to such English words as: hew, haggle, hoe, hag,
            hay, hack, caudad, caudal, caudate, caudex, coda, codex,
            codicil, coward, incus, and Kovač (personal name: "smith").
                + I will leave the exact derivations to the exegetes,
                  but I like the association with "haggle" myself.
    * *Contributions*
          o This draws on contributions or comments from:
                + Dixon Au
                + Joe Becker
                + Maurice Bauhahn
                + Abel Cheung
                + Peter Constable
                + Michael Everson
                + Christopher John Fynn
                + Michael Kaplan
                + George Kiraz
                + Abdul Malik
                + Siva Nataraja
                + Roozbeh Pournader
                + Jonathan Rosenne
                + Jungshik Shin
